  "There is a famous Conjecture in mathematics that says that every even integer greater than 2 has the property that it is the sum of two prime numbers (at least 1 pair, there can be more than 1). For example, for the even number 8, the Goldbach pair is (3, 5) because 3 + 5 = 8. For 12, the Goldbach pair is (5, 7) because 5 + 7 = 12. Similarly, for 28, one Goldbach pair is (5, 23) because 5 + 23 = 28, and also (11, 17) because 11 + 17 = 28. Computers have been used extensively to test this conjecture, and no counterexample has been found to disprove it till date. Implement the function below that finds all Goldbach pairs for all the even numbers passed as pointer arguments. The function returns a pointer to a 2D array containing pairs of Goldbach pairs for the integers at even_numbers, with the last pair being (-1, -1). Function: int** goldbach_pairs(int* even_numbers, int n); Use this function in a C program that takes even numbers from the user until -1 is entered. Then print all pairs returned through the memory location. Input Sample: 8 12 28 50 -1 Output Sample: (3, 5) (5, 7) (5, 23) (11, 17) (7, 43) (13, 37) (19, 31) (-1, -1)",
  "Generate a 2D array with dimensions M×N using dynamically allocated memory. The user keeps entering rows of the matrix until he/she types '-1'. The number of columns will be given in the first line. Your task is to allocate a new 2D array of dimensions (M-2)×(N-2), where result[i][j] = sum of the 3×3 matrix centered at (i+1, j+1). Example Input: 4 1234 5678 1234 5678 9874 -1 Example Output: Resultant matrix dimension = 2×4 30 39 42 51 30 39 48 49",
  "Write a C program that takes a list of positive integers from the user until -1 is entered. For each positive integer, compute its Collatz Conjecture sequence and print it. Implement the function: int* collatzSequence(int input); The function receives a positive integer and returns a pointer that stores the Collatz sequence for that number, ending with 1. Input Sample: 20 13 40 -1 Output Sample: 20 -> 10 -> 5 -> 16 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1 13 -> 40 -> 20 -> 10 -> 5 -> 16 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1 40 -> 20 -> 10 -> 5 -> 16 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1 The Collatz function applies repeatedly: if n is even, n = n/2; if n is odd, n = 3n + 1; until n reaches 1.",
  "Write a program containing a function that uses array-to-pointer notation to merge the contents of two sorted (ascending order) arrays of type double, storing the result in an output array parameter (still in ascending order). The function should not assume that both input arrays are the same length but should ensure that neither array contains duplicate values. The resulting array should also contain no duplicate values."

"Structures": [
  "Define a structure 'Point' with members x and y representing the coordinates of a point in a 2D plane. Define another structure 'Line' with members start and end, each of type Point, representing the start and end points of a line segment. Now define structures for Circle, Triangle, and Parallelogram. Your program must take input from the user (as shown in the example) and print the details of each shape, including area and perimeter. For a parallelogram, also mention whether it is a rectangle, square, or neither. For a triangle, mention if it is right-angled, isosceles, or equilateral. Hint: Distance between two points = √((x2 - x1)² + (y2 - y1)²), Area of triangle = |x1(y2 - y3) + x2(y3 - y1) + x3(y1 - y2)| / 2. Input Sample: Enter Number of Shapes: 3 Enter Shapes C236 T040454 T006035.2 Output Sample: Shape 1: Circle, Radius: 6 Area: 113.097 square units, Perimeter: 37.699 units Shape 2: Triangle Area: 32 square units, Perimeter: 24 units right-angled: NO, isosceles: NO, equilateral: NO Shape 3: Triangle Area: 15.6 square units, Perimeter: 18 units right-angled: NO, isosceles: YES, equilateral: YES",
  "Create a C program that helps students calculate SGPA and CGPA. The student will provide input via console in the form: course_id, gpa, credit_hours, and semester_number. SGPA is calculated as the sum of (gpa × credit_hours) divided by the sum of credit_hours for a particular semester. CGPA is the same but for all courses. For repeated course_id values, consider the one with the highest GPA for CGPA, and include the credit_hours only once in the total. Use structures to hold information for one course and make an array of this structure to store data for all courses. Input Sample: 101 3.00 3 1 102 2.33 3 1 108 1.33 3 1 108 2.33 3 2 201 3.33 3 2 202 3.67 3 2 Output Sample: Semester 1: 2.47 Semester 2: 2.75 CGPA: 2.71",
  "You are required to implement a Team Record Management System for multiple players, each having the following attributes: Team ID (integer), Name (string, max length 50), Total Wins (int), and Total Losses (int). Your program should implement the following functions: (1) Add a New Team: Append a new team record to the file. (2) Update a Team's Record: Update an existing team's match record by searching with the team ID and incrementing either wins or losses by 1. (3) Read Team Records: Display all teams, the team with the highest wins, and the team with the highest win percentage (wins / total matches), where total matches = wins + losses. Create a menu-driven program that allows the user to add, update, and display team records.",
  "Imagine you are developing a simple text-based RPG game and want to represent different types of game characters using a structure. Each character has specific attributes such as name, health points (HP), attack points (AP), and defense points (DP). To manage this information efficiently, define a structure named 'GameCharacter'. Consider the following restrictions: (a) The sum HP + AP + DP must be exactly 10. (b) HP, AP, and DP must all be between 1 and 5 (inclusive). (c) No two attribute values can be the same. (d) The name length must not exceed 80 characters. Write a C program that defines the GameCharacter structure and allows users to interact with game characters. Implement the following functions: (1) Create Characters: Allow the user to input details for multiple characters until they press the ESC key. (2) Display Characters: Print details of all characters and the total count. (3) Battle Simulation: Simulate a battle where two characters fight. Allow the user to select two characters, adjust health points based on attack and defense, and declare the winner based on remaining health."

  "You are developing a C program that performs advanced string manipulations on a text file for a text editor. Implement two functions that perform the following tasks: (1) Longest Words: Identify the three longest strings and surround them with <L> tags, returning an array of these three words. (2) Concatenate Strings: Concatenate all words surrounded with <s> and </s> into one word, remove the <s> tags, and replace them in the text. The program must read from a file named input.txt and write the modified version into output.txt. Print the three longest words on the console. Assume no line exceeds 80 characters.

  "Develop a C program that manages product and category information using file operations. The program should include the following functionalities: (1) Add Categories: Allow users to add new categories to categories.txt, each line containing a category name followed by a unique ID (e.g., 'Fruits 1'). (2) Add Products: Allow users to append product data to products.txt, each line containing a product name, its price, and the associated category ID (e.g., 'Apple 2.50 1'). (3) Generate Final Result: The program reads from both products.txt and categories.txt, organizes products by category, and creates an output file named final.txt. Each line in final.txt should display the category name along with its products and prices (e.g., 'Fruits Apple 2.50'). The program should be menu-driven, allowing the user to add categories, add products, or generate final.txt until the user chooses to exit by entering '0'. Example Files: categories.txt → 'Fruits 1', 'Electronics 2'; products.txt → 'Apple 2.50 1', 'Banana 1.20 1', 'TV 500.00 2', 'Laptop 1200.00 2'; final.txt → 'Fruits Apple 2.50', 'Fruits Banana 1.20', 'Electronics TV 500.00', 'Electronics Laptop 1200.00'.",
